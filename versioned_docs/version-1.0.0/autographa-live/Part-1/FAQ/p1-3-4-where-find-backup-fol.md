The auto back-up folder is in the same location that you give as the **_Export Folder Location_** in **_Translation Details_** settings.

To learn how to select the back-up folder location, refer [_Selecting the export folder location for the translation text_](../Getting-Started/Basic-settings-in-Autographa-Live/Setting-up-the-Translation-Details/p1-3-3-4-select-export-folder-location-transltn.mdx)
